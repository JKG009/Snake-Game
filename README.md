# Snake-Game

Classic snake game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

# How to play

Select a difficulty level.
Use either the arrow keys or the WASD keys.

# Other Information

This is the first project that I uploaded onto Github.
It is made after going through a Scrimba module, however, I decided to implement additional functionalities to make it my own project and also played around with CSS.
Additional functions includes:
  - 3 difficulty levels and a message when a difficulty level is not selected
  - A high score system that used local storage to store your previous games
  - A small fix where the snake can not go back onto itself
